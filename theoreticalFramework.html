									<h3 class="major">What is Machine Learning?</h3>
									<h4>Definition</h4>
									<p>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. Through the use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, and to uncover key insights in data mining projects. These insights subsequently drive decision making within applications and businesses, ideally impacting key growth metrics.</p>
									<p>Machine learning models fall into three primary categories:</p>
									
									<h4>Supervised machine learning</h4>
									<p>Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, the model adjusts its weights until it has been fitted appropriately. This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the model avoids overfitting or underfitting. </p>
									<p>Under the umbrella of supervised learning fall: Classification, Regression and Forecasting.</p>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Classification: </strong>In classification tasks, the machine learning program must draw a conclusion from observed values and determine to what category new observations belong.</li>
										<li><strong>Regression: </strong>In regression tasks, the machine learning program must estimate, and understand, the relationships among variables. Regression analysis focuses on one dependent variable and a series of other changing variables, making it particularly useful for prediction and forecasting.</li>
										<li><strong>Forecasting: </strong>Forecasting is the process of making predictions about the future based on the past and present data, and is commonly used to analyse trends.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<h4>Unsupervised machine learning</h4>
									<p>Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. This method’s ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it ideal for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image and pattern recognition. It’s also used to reduce the number of features in a model through the process of dimensionality reduction.</p>
									<p>Under the umbrella of unsupervised learning, fall:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Clustering: </strong>Clustering involves grouping sets of similar data (based on defined criteria). It's useful for segmenting data into several groups and performing analysis on each data set to find patterns.</li>
										<li><strong>Dimension reduction: </strong>Dimension reduction reduces the number of variables being considered to find the exact information required.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<h4>Semi-supervised learning </h4>
									<p>Semi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and unsupervised learning. During training, it uses a smaller labeled data set to guide classification and feature extraction from a larger, unlabeled data set. Semi-supervised learning can solve the problem of not having enough labeled data for a supervised learning algorithm. It also helps if it’s too costly to label enough data. </p>
									
									<h3 class="major">Algorithms</h3>
									<p>Choosing the right machine learning algorithm depends on several factors, including, but not limited to: data size, quality and diversity, as well as what answers businesses want to derive from that data. Additional considerations include accuracy, training time, parameters, data points and much more. Therefore, choosing the right algorithm is both a combination of business need, specification, experimentation and time available.</p>
									<p>Here are some of the most common and popular Machine Learning algorithms:</p>
									<h4>Linear Regression - Supervised Learning/Regression</h4>
									<p>Linear regression is the most basic type of regression. Simple linear regression allows us to understand the relationships between two continuous variables. </p>
									<h4>Logistic Regression - Supervised Learning/Classification</h4>
									<p>Logistic regression focuses on estimating the probability of an event occurring based on the previous data provided. It is used to cover a binary dependent variable, that is where only two values, 0 and 1, represent outcomes.</p>
									<h4>Naïve Bayes Classifier Algorithm - Supervised Learning/Classification</h4>
									<p>The Naïve Bayes classifier is based on Bayes' theorem and classifies every value as independent of any other value. It allows us to predict a class/category, based on a given set of features, using probability. Despite its simplicity, the classifier does surprisingly well and is often used due to the fact it outperforms more sophisticated classification methods.</p>
									<h4>Nearest Neighbours - Supervised Learning</h4>
									<p>The K-Nearest-Neighbour algorithm estimates how likely a data point is to be a member of one group or another. It essentially looks at the data points around a single data point to determine what group it is actually in. For example, if one point is on a grid and the algorithm is trying to determine what group that data point is in (Group A or Group B, for example) it would look at the data points near it to see what group the majority of the points are in.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Studying the data</h3>
									<h4>Data Preparation</h4>
									<p>Data preparation is the process of preparing raw data so that it is suitable for further processing and analysis. Key steps include collecting, cleaning, and labeling raw data into a form suitable for machine learning algorithms and then exploring and visualizing the data. Data preparation can take up to 80% of the time spent on an ML project. Using specialized data preparation tools is important to optimize this process. Data preparation includes missing values, outliers, transformations, attribute selection, and some other aspects.</p>	
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Missing Values:</strong> The real-world data often has a lot of missing values. The cause of missing values can be data corruption or failure to record data. The handling of missing data is very important during the preprocessing of the dataset as many machine learning algorithms do not support missing values.</li>
										<li><strong>Outliers:</strong> Outliers are those data points that are significantly different from the rest of the dataset. They are often abnormal observations that skew the data distribution, and arise due to inconsistent data entry, or erroneous observations.</li>
										<li><strong>Transformations:</strong> Data transformation is the process of converting raw data into a format or structure that would be more suitable for model building and also data discovery in general.</li>
										<li><strong>Attribute Selection:</strong> Attributes selection is the process of identifying and removing attributes from a training data set as much
											irrelevant and redundant attributes as possible. This reduces the dimensionality of the data.</li>
