									<h3 class="major">What is Machine Learning?</h3>
									<h4>Definition</h4>
									<p>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. Through the use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, and to uncover key insights in data mining projects. These insights subsequently drive decision making within applications and businesses, ideally impacting key growth metrics.</p>
									<p>Machine learning models fall into three primary categories:</p>
									<h4>Supervised machine learning</h4>
									<p>Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, the model adjusts its weights until it has been fitted appropriately. This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the model avoids overfitting or underfitting. </p>
									<h4>Unsupervised machine learning</h4>
									<p>Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. This method’s ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it ideal for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image and pattern recognition. It’s also used to reduce the number of features in a model through the process of dimensionality reduction.</p>
									<h4>Semi-supervised learning </h4>
									<p>Semi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and unsupervised learning. During training, it uses a smaller labeled data set to guide classification and feature extraction from a larger, unlabeled data set. Semi-supervised learning can solve the problem of not having enough labeled data for a supervised learning algorithm. It also helps if it’s too costly to label enough data. </p>

									<h3 class="major">Algorithms</h3>
									<h4>Linear Algorithms</h4>
									<p>Linear machine learning algorithms assume a linear relationship between the features and the target variable. You can use linear algorithms for classification and regression problems.</p>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong> Linear regression is one of the oldest and most popular algorithms. The algorithm is used for solving regression problems. This means that the final output of the model is a numeric value. The algorithm maps a linear relationship between the input features(X) and the output (y).</li>
									</ul>

									<h3 class="major">Studying the data</h3>
									<h4>Data Preparation</h4>
									<p>Data preparation is the process of preparing raw data so that it is suitable for further processing and analysis. Key steps include collecting, cleaning, and labeling raw data into a form suitable for machine learning algorithms and then exploring and visualizing the data. Data preparation can take up to 80% of the time spent on an ML project. Using specialized data preparation tools is important to optimize this process. Data preparation includes missing values, outliers, transformations, attribute selection, and some other aspects.</p>	
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Missing Values:</strong> The real-world data often has a lot of missing values. The cause of missing values can be data corruption or failure to record data. The handling of missing data is very important during the preprocessing of the dataset as many machine learning algorithms do not support missing values.</li>
										<li><strong>Outliers:</strong> Outliers are those data points that are significantly different from the rest of the dataset. They are often abnormal observations that skew the data distribution, and arise due to inconsistent data entry, or erroneous observations.</li>
										<li><strong>Transformations:</strong> Data transformation is the process of converting raw data into a format or structure that would be more suitable for model building and also data discovery in general.</li>
										<li><strong>Attribute Selection:</strong> Attributes selection is the process of identifying and removing attributes from a training data set as much
											irrelevant and redundant attributes as possible. This reduces the dimensionality of the data.</li>
